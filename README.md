This project is a **Fake News Detection System** that uses **Machine Learning** to classify news articles as **REAL** or **FAKE**. The model is trained using a **Random Forest Classifier** with **TF-IDF vectorization** and is deployed using a **Flask web application**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Trains a **Random Forest Classifier** on a dataset of news articles.
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** to process text data.
- Saves the trained model for future predictions.
- Provides a **Flask web interface** for users to check the authenticity of news articles.
